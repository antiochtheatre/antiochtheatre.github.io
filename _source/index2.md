#After nearly 100 years, the beloved Antioch Theatre is now closed.<br>With your help, we can open its doors once again.

<a href="http://kickstarter.com" class="cta-button">Back our project on Kickstarter</a>

Together we can renovate, expand, and reopen for a long and healthy future&mdash;providing Antioch with first-run movies at an affordable price in a historic, traditional downtown theater.




Antioch Theatre opened around 1919
as a live theater, and converted to a single screen “movie house” in 1924.



The Theatre served area residents
through the roaring 20s, prohibition,
and the gangster era. It survived the Great Depression and hosted returning WWII soldiers. It provided first-run family
friendly films for over 90 years!

Unfortunately, in recent times, deferred
maintenance and outdated projection
technology put the Antioch Theatre
in a dire financial situation. The theater closed its doors on May 16, 2014.
