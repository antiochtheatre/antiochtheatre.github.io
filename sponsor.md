##Sidewalk Stars

Permanent engraved granite sidewalk stars will be embedded in the newly heated sidewalk outside the renovated theatre.  A glossy, black star will be in the center of a sandblasted medium-gray stone. A message of your choice will be slightly recessed and stained in gold in the center of the star. These heated sidewalk stars will be visible any time of the year – your investment will never be covered in that Lake County snow and ice! These stars are available in the following sizes and prices:

* ~24” x 24” ($5,000)
* ~18” x 18” ($3,500)
* ~12” x 12” ($1,500) 

Join Raymond Chevrolet, Something Sweet and many other prominent businesses, individuals and families that wish to permanently acknowledge their support for downtown and the Antioch Theatre.
