<!-- The theater is an unassuming gem in downtown Antioch—losing it would be devastating for our community. Together we can renovate, expand, and reopen for a prosperous future. -->

## A storied past, and an uncertain future.

The theater first opened in 1919, as a live performance house called the Majestic Theatre. In 1924 it was converted to a single-screen movie theater and renamed the Antioch Theatre.

It thrived and survived through prohibition, the gangster era, and the Great Depression. It hosted returning WWII soldiers. It's been a popular venue for affordable, family-friendly movies for three generations.

Unfortunately, in recent times, deferred maintenance and outdated projection
technology put the Antioch Theatre in a dire financial situation. The theater closed its doors on May 16, 2014.

## Why save the theatre?

Movie theaters are like heartbeats for small downtowns. They attract people of all ages—not just for movies, but to dine, shop, and drink. They create a space for people to gather.

When a downtown theater closes, fewer people visit, and other businesses suffer too. Restoring Antioch Theatre will ensure that doesn’t happen!

With our extensive renovation plan, we’ll have improved technology, expanded facilities, and new possibilities for special live broadcast events (ballet, opera, sporting events), performances (comedy, music, speakers), and more!
Preserving the theater will help Downtown Antioch remain vibrant and active for years to come.

## Here's how we'll make it happen.

The theater is in poor condition, and its single screen minimizes its financial viability by limiting the number of movies it can show. 

In order to not only salvage the theater, but to renovate, reopen, and expand for long-term financial viability, a local property owner has committed significant funds and assembled the financial support of the local business community to put forth a $750,000 redevelopment plan. To date, $650,000 has been committed with an additional $35,000 to be raised through sidewalk star sales and other promotions. *We're asking our Kickstarter supporters to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/608543555/493992288?token=12c9ea62">help raise the final $65,000</a>.*

## Our renovation plan: a fresh start and a new beginning.

We have extensive improvements planned, including:

* Additional 29-seat boutique theater
* All new digital projection and sound
* New screens, drapery, and seating
* New classic marquee
* Redesigned façade
* Renovated lobby
* Sprinkler fire protection
* ...But the rare, beloved balcony will remain historic!

Digital projection will provide outstanding quality allowing the theater to continue to show first-run releases.  It will also permit the theater to broadcast live and special events such as ballet, opera, sporting events, and gaming competitions.  Since the Antioch Theatre was originally a performance theater, its modest stage will remain and the theater can host speakers, comedy shows, small musical performances, and community events.

The additional screen is critical for successful operation in the future.  Movie distributors require theaters to hold films for 2-4 weeks.  However, as a movie’s attendance drops during its run, a single screen theater is burdened with little income while it waits for the next new release.  With a new second screen, the revitalized Antioch Theatre would be able to transfer a movie onto the smaller screen in the latter weeks of its run and show a new release in the original, larger theater.
