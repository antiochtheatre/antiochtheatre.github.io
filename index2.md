## Here&rsquo;s the story of the Antioch Theatre.

Originally called the Majestic Theatre, the theater first opened in 1919 in Antioch, Illinois, as a live performance house.

In 1924, it was converted to a single-screen movie theater and renamed the Antioch Theatre. Most of downtown Antioch’s business district was developed around this time too.

The theater survived and thrived for 90 years &mdash; through prohibition, the Great Depression, and World War II. It's been a popular venue for affordable, family-friendly movies for three generations.

Unfortunately, in recent times, deferred maintenance and outdated
technology put the Antioch Theatre in a dire financial situation. The current owner closed its doors on May 16, 2014.

## Why should we save it?

Movie theaters are like heartbeats for small downtowns. They're a gathering place for people of all ages—not just for movies, but to dine, shop, and drink.

When a downtown theater closes, fewer people visit, and other businesses suffer too. We want to make sure that doesn't happen! 

After the renovation, we’ll have improved technology, expanded facilities, and great new possibilities for live events and performances. Saving the theater will help downtown Antioch remain vibrant for years to come.

## Our plan: new tech and better facilities for a fresh start.

We have extensive improvements planned&mdash;the building will be revamped inside and out. Here are just a few of the highlights:

<div class="renovation">
<ul>
<li>Additional 29-seat boutique theater</li>
<li>All new digital projection and sound</li>
<li>New screens, drapery, and seating</li>
<li>New marquee and redesigned facade</li>
<li>Renovated lobby and restrooms</li>
<li>Sprinkler fire protection</li>
<li>Preservation of the historic balcony</li>
</ul>
</div>

Digital projection will allow the theater to show first-run releases and broadcast special events such as ballet, opera, sports, etc. The performance stage will remain, so the theater can host talks, comedy shows, musical performances, and other live events.

## Here's how we're funding the project.

In order to renovate, expand, and reopen, we've budgeted the comprehensive redevelopment at $750,000.

To date, $650,000 has been committed by the overwhelmingly generous support of local businesses and property owners (thanks, everyone!) We hope to collect an additional $35,000 through sidewalk star sales and other promotions. 

*We still need your help. We&rsquo;re counting on Kickstarter supporters to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/608543555/493992288?token=12c9ea62">help us raise the final $65,000</a>.*
