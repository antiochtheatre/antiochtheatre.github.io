<section><a name="about"></a>
## Here&rsquo;s the story of the Antioch Theatre.

Originally called the Majestic Theatre, the theater first opened in 1919 in Antioch, Illinois, as a live performance house.

In 1924, it was converted to a single-screen movie theater and renamed the Antioch Theatre. Most of downtown Antiochâ€™s business district was developed around this time too.

The theater survived and thrived for 90 years &mdash; through prohibition, the Great Depression, and World War II. It's been a popular venue for affordable, family-friendly movies for three generations.

Unfortunately, in recent times, deferred maintenance and outdated
technology put the Antioch Theatre in a dire financial situation. The current owner closed its doors on May 16, 2014.

## Our plan: new tech and better facilities for a fresh start.

We have extensive improvements planned&mdash;the building will be revamped inside and out. Here are just a few of the highlights:

<div class="renovation">
<ul>
<li>Additional 29-seat boutique theater</li>
<li>All new digital projection and sound</li>
<li>New screens, drapery, and seating</li>
<li>New marquee and redesigned facade</li>
<li>Renovated lobby and heated front sidewalk</li>
<li>Sprinkler fire protection</li>
<li>Preservation of the historic balcony</li>
</ul>
</div>

Digital projection will allow the theater to show first-run releases and broadcast special events such as ballet, opera, and sports. The performance stage will remain, so the theater can host talks, comedy shows, musical performances, and other live events (but we&rsquo;ll never offer plays that compete with the wonderful PM&amp;L Theater in downtown Antioch!)
